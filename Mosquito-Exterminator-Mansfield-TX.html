<p>It is found often that we need pest control only in a specific area and not all over. Our online courses include Crop Pest Diagnostics and Management, as well as the first-ever web-based sanitary and phytosanitary procedures curriculum (sponsored by USAID). Integrated pest management requires an understanding of the ecology of the cropping system, consisting of that of the pests, their natural opponents, and the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>There are many agricultural practices that make the environment less beneficial to insect pests. IPM extended the idea of incorporated control to all classes of pests and was broadened to include all strategies. This chapter talks about different approaches to preserve pest insects at tolerable levels or to put it simply incorporated pest management (IPM). Keep family pets and kids away from locations where pesticides have actually been used.</p>
