Pest exemption with netting or row covers, vacuuming or handpicking to remove pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, modifying environmental conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sterilization or solarization, physical or visual bird deterrents such as reflective material or sonic devices are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>
