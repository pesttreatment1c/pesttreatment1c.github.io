<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a community approach to crop production and security that combines various management techniques and practices to grow healthy crops and minimize using pesticides. The entrance holes of some pest are smaller sized than can be seen by the human eye, so there may be no visible damage to packaging containing pests. Pests interact with each other, the crop, and the environment. Biological controls-- Natural biological procedures and materials can provide control, with appropriate environmental impact, and often at lower expense.</p>
<p>For instance, management of the Soybean aphid consists of entomologists who study the insect and their damage to soybean, agronomists that recognize crop stage which are most vulnerable to soybean aphid damage, plant pathologists who study the viruses sent by aphid feeding, and soil researchers who study the aphids interaction with nutrient deficiencies.</p>
