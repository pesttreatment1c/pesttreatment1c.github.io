<p>It is also obvious from many discussions with growers and pest control experts in California that resistance management seen as turning pesticides amongst different mode of action groups is typically viewed as IPM, although resistance management is just a part of IPM. Pest control is the regulation or management of a species defined as a pest, a member of the animal kingdom that impacts negatively on human activities.</p>
<p>As the federal authority under the Pest Control Products Act (PCPA), the PMRA establishes pest management policies and guidelines; promotes sustainable pest management; seeks to improve the regulative procedure to increase efficiency; implements compliance with the PCPA; and, distributes pest management information to the general public and crucial stakeholders.</p>

Controls of insect reproductive systems techniques such as sterilized insect method (SIT) and incompatible insect strategy (IIT) offer innovative and environmental-friendly approaches for IPM. Apply pesticides when they are most effective. Pests pollute products, cause structural damage, and are serious public health concerns for businesses and homes.</p>
