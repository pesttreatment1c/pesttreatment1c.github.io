<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical approaches such as cultural practices, use of resistant varieties, correct irrigation and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM thinks about the community as a whole and thinks about a balanced mix of the previously mentioned control methods to produce the most effective and least damaging strategy.</p>
<p>When pest problems are prevented, pests are not present to do damage, so no control procedures are needed. Arthropod resistance to abamectin (Stumpf and Nauen 2002 ), B. thuringiensis formulations or its cry toxins in genetically modified crops (Hama et al. 1992, Tabashnik et al. 2013 ), spinosad (Scott 2008 ), and other biopesticides (Dara 2017) are well documented.</p>
<p>IPM techniques consist of both chemical and nonchemical ways to avoid and control pest populations from reaching financially damaging levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the tiniest efficient dose when other techniques of pest control have actually failed. IPM is an ecosystem-based technique that concentrates on long-term avoidance of pests or their damage through a mix of strategies such as biological control, habitat manipulation, modification of cultural practices, and usage of resistant ranges.</p>
